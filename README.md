# python_aim_trainer
Aim trainer created using PyGame. The code follows the YouTube video from Tech with Tim with some additional code that I wrote to allow you to replay the game without exiting the pygame window. I also added a "best score" for each of the stats that were recorded (time, speed, hits, accuracy)
